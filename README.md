# **Firebase Authentication Client**

Firebase Authentication Client is a simple frontend that helps you login and get user and authentication details from Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) service.

After building multiple backend applications utilizing Firebase for authentication, it became apparent that I needed a way to easily get authentication tokens, evaluate custom claims, and other tasks that require a frontend Firebase client. To that end, I created this frontend client as a general purpose tool for anyone's use.

Visit the application at [https://auth-client.netlify.app](https://auth-client.netlify.app).

## **How it's built**

The frontend application is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
